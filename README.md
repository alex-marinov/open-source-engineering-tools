## FreeCAD - https://www.freecadweb.org/.  
FreeCAD is an open-source parametric 3D modeler made primarily to design real-life objects of any size. Parametric modeling allows you to easily modify your design by going back into your model history and changing its parameters.   

## Open Cascade Technology - https://dev.opencascade.org/
is an open-source software development platform for 3D CAD, CAM, CAE, etc. that is developed and supported by Open Cascade SAS.

## Gmsh - https://gmsh.info/
A three-dimensional finite element mesh generator with built-in pre- and post-processing facilities.

## blender - https://www.blender.org/
Blender is the free and open source 3D creation suite. It supports the entirety of the 3D pipelineâ€”modeling, rigging, animation, simulation, rendering, compositing and motion tracking, video editing and 2D animation pipeline.

## appleseed - https://appleseedhq.net/
appleseed is an open source, physically-based global illumination rendering engine primarily designed for animation and visual effects.

## Sverchok - https://github.com/nortikin/sverchok/
Sverchok is a powerful parametric tool for architects, allowing geometry to be programmed visually with nodes.   

## KiCAD - https://kicad.org/
A Cross Platform and Open Source Electronics Design Automation Suite.  

## MBDyn - https://www.mbdyn.org/
MBDyn features the integrated multidisciplinary simulation of multibody, multiphysics systems, including nonlinear mechanics of rigid and flexible bodies (geometrically exact & composite-ready beam and shell finite elements, component mode synthesis elements, lumped elements) subjected to kinematic constraints, along with smart materials, electric networks, active control, hydraulic networks, and essential fixed-wing and rotorcraft aerodynamics.   

## openMDAO - https://openmdao.org/
An open-source framework for efficient multidisciplinary optimization.

## GNU Octave - https://www.gnu.org/software/octave/
Scientific Programming Language, Drop-in compatible with many Matlab scripts.

## Modelica - https://www.modelica.org/
The Modelica Language is a non-proprietary, object-oriented, equation based language to conveniently model complex physical systems containing, e.g., mechanical, electrical, electronic, hydraulic, thermal, control, electric power or process-oriented subcomponents.   

## OpenModelica - https://www.openmodelica.org/
OPENMODELICA is an open-source Modelica-based modeling and simulation environment intended for industrial and academic usage.
