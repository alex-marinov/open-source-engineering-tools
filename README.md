Open Source Engineering Tools.  
   
FreeCAD - https://www.freecadweb.org/.  
FreeCAD is an open-source parametric 3D modeler made primarily to design real-life objects of any size. Parametric modeling allows you to easily modify your design by going back into your model history and changing its parameters.   

blender - https://www.blender.org/.  
Blender is the free and open source 3D creation suite. It supports the entirety of the 3D pipelineâ€”modeling, rigging, animation, simulation, rendering, compositing and motion tracking, video editing and 2D animation pipeline.

appleseed - https://appleseedhq.net/.  
appleseed is an open source, physically-based global illumination rendering engine primarily designed for animation and visual effects.

KiCAD - https://kicad.org/.  
A Cross Platform and Open Source Electronics Design Automation Suite.  

MBDyn - https://www.mbdyn.org/. 
MBDyn features the integrated multidisciplinary simulation of multibody, multiphysics systems, including nonlinear mechanics of rigid and flexible bodies (geometrically exact & composite-ready beam and shell finite elements, component mode synthesis elements, lumped elements) subjected to kinematic constraints, along with smart materials, electric networks, active control, hydraulic networks, and essential fixed-wing and rotorcraft aerodynamics.   

GNU Octave - https://www.gnu.org/software/octave/.  
Scientific Programming Language, Drop-in compatible with many Matlab scripts

https://www.modelica.org/ The Modelica Language is a non-proprietary, object-oriented, equation based language to conveniently model complex physical systems containing, e.g., mechanical, electrical, electronic, hydraulic, thermal, control, electric power or process-oriented subcomponents.   

OpenModelica - https://www.openmodelica.org/.  
OPENMODELICA is an open-source Modelica-based modeling and simulation environment intended for industrial and academic usage.
